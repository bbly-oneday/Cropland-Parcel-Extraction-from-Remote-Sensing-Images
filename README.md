# Cropland-Parcel-Extraction-from-Remote-Sensing-Images
We propose an optimized Segment Anything Model (SAM) to accurately extract diverse cropland parcels. By integrating adaptive prompt generation, overlap filtering, and boundary stitching, our method enables efficient extraction with minimal supervision.
